## User Story
As an employer I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio seeting out his skills. It would allow us to assess your ability to use Bootstrap to create a website.

## Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements to develop a portfolio that statisfies a typical manager's needs:
<ul>
    <li>When the page is loaded, it presents a Jumbotron featuring your name, your picture, and links to sections about you, your work and how to contact you</li>
    <li>Use of Bootstrap to optimise the user experience</li>
    <li>Having an active and healthy commit history on GitHub</li>
    <li>Use of Bootstrap-cards to present your projects and add a brief description </li>
</ul>
